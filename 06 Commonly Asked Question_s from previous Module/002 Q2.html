<p>Q)<strong>&nbsp; if i assign value to 'a' before initial begin , output in console is error,</strong></p><p><strong>code is</strong></p><p><strong>module tb;</strong></p><p><strong>integer a;</strong></p><p><strong>a=12;</strong></p><p><strong>initial begin</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>$display("value of a: %0d",a);</strong></p><p><strong>end</strong></p><p><strong>endmodule</strong></p><p><strong> if i assign value to 'a' inside initial begin , output in console i am getting with no error why, (Arvind Kumar)</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Ans.</p><p>So for this '=' can serve 2 purposes either Assignment or initialization.</p><p>When you are targeting initialization, you need to add value exactly at the place where you declare variable. That is the reason when you write</p><p>integer a = 12; //This is valid since you are initializing the variable at the same place.</p><p>but after this, if you wish to add value to the variable that will act as an assignment which can be done in two ways either procedural or concurrent.</p><p>So if you are targeting Continous assignment after variable declaration you must add a statement like this</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">module tb;integer a;&nbsp;assign a = 12;&nbsp;endmodule </pre><p>else if you are targetting Procedural assignment then you can add a statement like this</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">module tb;integer a;&nbsp;initial begin  a = 12;end   endmodule</pre><p>OR</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">module tb;integer a;&nbsp;always begin  a = 12;end&nbsp;endmodule</pre><p>The difference between two procedural assignments is the first code will only execute once during a simulation at the beginning whereas the second code executes for the entire simulation duration until the user forcefully stops the simulation.</p><p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Just an extra thought if you compare Verilog with C, you will be finding initialization exactly similar to verilog (i.e. int a = 12) but assignment in c is always blocking or sequential So initial, always, and assign are not implicitly used in C (It does not support non-blocking)as we do it in verilog.</p><p>Verilog can be considered as more formal as compared to C.</p><p>Hope this helps.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>
