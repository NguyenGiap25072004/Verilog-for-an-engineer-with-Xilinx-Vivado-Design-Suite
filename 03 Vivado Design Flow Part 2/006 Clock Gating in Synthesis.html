<p>Gate Cloking is a standard way of reducing the power by controlling when to turn on the device when required. Let us try to understand how we add a Clocking gate without modifying the Design using Synthesis Setting strategies and Synthesis constructs.</p><p>Let us understand this with an example.</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">module dff(
    input clk, din,
    output reg dout
    );

dout &lt;= din;
end  
endmodule

module top(clk, a, din, dout);
input clk, a,din;
output  dout;

wire t1;

assign t1 = a &amp; clk;
dff d1 (t1,din,dout);

So When we add multiple such Gated logic in the design finding them and replacing them in the complex design is an ardous task.</p><p>One strategy we could adopt here as we recognize the problem is to remove all the gate and connect the gating signal (a) to the Clock Enable pin of the Register. Considering the simple rtl mentioned above the process is very simple but with the complex design removing all the gates and connecting the gating signal can lead to significant changes to the design.</p><p><br></p><p>Let us try to understand how Vivado automatically handle this process for us.</p><p>Go to Settings -&gt; Synthesis -&gt; Enable gated_clock_conversion</p><figure><img src="https://img-c.udemycdn.com/redactor/raw/article_lecture/2021-06-10_18-54-58-8eb474c7b2bf8d43002621d504b3c2fb.png"></figure><p><strong><em>Fig. 3: Synthesis Settings</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p>After you turn on gated_Clock_conversion in the synthesis settings.
