<p><strong>Q) We generate bit file after coding in the LUT,or before? (Vivek Mandal)</strong></p><p>We generate bit file after performing Synthesis and Implementation which convert HDL code to netlist(UNISIM library component which can be implemented on FPGA's). So it contains values of to be store in LUT along with the Specific CLB, Slice identification where LUT is loacted.</p>
