<p>RTL View is a <strong>Register Transfer Level</strong> graphical representation of your design. This representation (.ngr file produced by Xilinx Synthesis Technology (XST)) is generated by the synthesis tool at earlier stages of a synthesis process when technology mapping is not yet completed. The <strong>goal of this view</strong> is to be as close as <strong>possible to the original HDL code</strong>. In the <strong>RTL view</strong>, the<strong> design is represented</strong> in terms of <strong>macro blocks, such as adders, multipliers, and registers</strong>. <strong>Standard combinatorial logic</strong> is <strong>mapped onto </strong>logic gates, such as <strong>AND, NAND, and OR.</strong></p>
